This is a sample project that produces a procedural Skeleatal Mesh inside UE 5.1.
In game play, you may press 1 and 0 in your keyboard, to increase the size of the cylinder, what actually happens is that upon pressing those keys you create a New Bone, and a new cylinder section associated with that bone.
